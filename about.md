The Citizenâ€™s Guide aims to provide citizens with tools to understand what makes up open data (OD), how it can be used in their communities, and where to find it.

The Citizen's Guide is designed to be a living document with many diverse contributors. We hope that many people of varying perspectives can find the guide useful, and to help make it more useful for others. In particular, we hope that the guide can become a place to share stories about Open Data, and equip people with the concepts and tools to better participate in the Open Data discourse.
