Data is open when it can be accessed and put to use. Much data is not open

However, ‘Open Data’ doesn’t mean that data is open to only someone–like a city official–but that it is designed to be accessible by everyone. The [Open Knowledge Foundation](https://okfn.org/) ([OKF](https://okfn.org/)) breaks Openness into three categories:

- Open Access: Open Data must be freely available for download online (see also, [Where to Find Open Data](#) below)
- Open Format: Open Data must be come in file formats that do not require proprietary software to open. Open Data must also be machine-readable (see [file formats](#) above)
- Open License: Data must be released with a license that conforms with open requirements (see [Open Licenses](#) below)

OKF’s [Global Open Data Index](http://index.okfn.org/), generated annually through a crowd-sourced survey, ranks each country’s openness according to how governments actually publish the data. The measurement is young, and as a result the measures themselves have been adjusted annually. In 2015 they looked at 13 types of datasets and determined whether they were (Global Open Index, 2015):

- openly licensed
- machine-readable
- freely available
- available in bulk
- updated regularly
- available online
- available digitally
- publicly available
- exists/collected
