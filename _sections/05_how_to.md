Many civil services have teams working to prepare open data for release. In some cases, as in Toronto, the desire is that all data will be '[open by default](http://open.canada.ca/en/Canada%E2%80%99s_Directive_on_Open_Government_%E2%80%93_Creating_a_Culture_of_%E2%80%9COpen_by_Default%E2%80%9D)', unless there are concerns about confidentiality or security (City of Toronto, 2016; Government of Canada, 2015). Opening data takes work- the process by which data is collected determines whether it adheres to the standards of interoperability (open formats) that governments now try to follow with their datasets. Given this commitment, many datasets are not suitable to release in their current form, and require reworking. Fortunately, civil services are often enthusiastic to open their data to the publicâ€“ that's who open data is for!

If the data sets you would like to use are not readily available through a data catalogue, you can often [request them](http://open.canada.ca/en/suggested-datasets), this is sometimes known as 'petitioning for release'. Some cities, like [Edmonton](https://permits.edmonton.ca/Default.aspx?PossePresentation=NewDataRequest&PosseObjectDef=j_OpenDataRequest), [Toronto](http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=3647e03bb8d1e310VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD) and [Vancouver](http://vancouver.ca/your-government/open-data-survey.aspx), have request forms on their data catalogues, and also accept requests via email or twitter. The province of [Ontario has used voting](https://www.ontario.ca/page/sharing-government-data) to prioritize the opening of data sets as well. In general, one should not hesitate to contact their governments to have needed data sets released.
