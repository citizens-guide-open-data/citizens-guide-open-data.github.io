title: "What is Data?"
--- 

Data is a fuzzy concept—a definitive definition is nearly impossible to come by, and the difference between data and information, knowledge, and truth is a matter of philosophical dispute. We don't need to get into that here. Instead, this guide will focus on the kinds of data, and their uses, that often come up when we talk about open data- a term which we'll know a lot more about by the end of this section.

A piece of data is anything that says something about the world. Anything that can be sensed or measured can be considered data, whether by our human senses, or by machines. Just as your eyes ‘sense’ data about colour, size, shape, location and movement, so too do scales measure weight, and smart phones store data that is displayed as text, phone numbers, or photos.

But this is only half the picture—data is often considered to be what scholars call 'theory-laden', meaning that every piece of data is also related to a concept, and there is no “pure” data. Think about the example of colour; these data only have meaning if we have words to describe them, and might change if we have new words. For example, if you knew only 16 colours, you might call this one green—but if you knew 256 colours then you might call it teal. Imagine if you didn't know any words for colour!

## Data for Computers

Computers provide a particularly good example of why concepts are important. Computers store all of their data in the form of binary code—huge collections of 1s and 0s. This data is meaningless to humans, and it is meaningless to computers unless they know what to do with it. When sections of those 0s and 1s are looked at together, with concepts (or data types), they have meaning. Some common ones are text, numbers and true/false values. If you've ever tried opening a file without the proper program, you know what it means when your computer doesn't have a concept for some data.
