title: "What are File Formats?"
---

File formats are agreed upon and standardized ways information is encoded for use by computers. A format describes how the file is represented when stored. Files end in _extensions_ (for example: .mp3, .html, .doc) which usually are shortened versions of the format name.

Just as data needs concepts to have meaning, they also need context to be meaningful.
Changing the context, by expanding it for example, can reveal data’s different aspects. For example, if I say your favourite hockey team lost, you might feel one way—but if I mention that many of the players had been injured or sick before the game, you might feel a different way.
