title: Open Formats and Standards
---

The things we do with files every day are only possible because of the ability for different programs and files to talk to each other. File formats use specifications to accomplish this. However, while specifications that allow programs and files to interact may be published, this is not the same as an open or free file format. An open format refers to a format where not only the specification, but also the IP rights are Open (see [Open Licenses](#) below).Some examples of open formats include **.zip** and **.flac**, as an aside, not all formats that are open started out that way: **.pdfs** and **.gifs**, both very popular, were originally closed formats. 

Standards for Openness are set by international organizations like the International Organization for Standardization, which standardizes file formats by keeping documentation on their construction. Other organizations are now setting standards specifically for the use of Open Data. World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has published documentation on best practises for Open Data publishing. The Popolo project is specifically geared toward standardizing Open Data metadata, which makes it easier to compare similar data from different jurisdictions. Whether governments make their Open Data conform to these standards is another matter entirely (see [Open Government Partnerships](#) below).
