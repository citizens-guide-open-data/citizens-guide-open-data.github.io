title: Open Source vs. Free Software
---

Software is "Open Source" as long as the source code (of the computer programs, algorithms, etc that allow a program to run) can be copied and inspected by users (LINFO, 2007).  The 'Free' in Free Software does not necessarily mean "free of charge," but rather means that a program is free in four ways: freedom to run it, freedom to study and modify its source code (so all free software has source code available), freedom to distribute the code (no intellectual property constraints), and freedom to distribute modified versions of the software (Kagan, 2011).
