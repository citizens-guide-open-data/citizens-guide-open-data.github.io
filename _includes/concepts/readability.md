Closely tied to structured and unstructured data is the idea of readability. We say that data 'human-readable' if they can easily be read by people-- like text in sentences and paragraphs, but also numeric data in tables. Humans can often understand things that are human readable even if they're not told exactly how to understand. Machines, on the other hand, require very specific instructions to know what do with information. This is why 'machine-readable' information has to be structured.
