Open is one of those words that can be confusing. It simultaneously means a lot of things and many of those meanings are used when talking about related concepts (Pomerantz & Peek, 2016). Many different groups have established definitions of ‘open’ to try and make sure conversations are taking place with the same vocabulary. One of those definitions, put forward by the  Open Knowledge Foundation (OKF) and specifically addressing the domain of knowledge, takes open to mean “anyone is free to access, use, modify, and share it — subject, at most, to measures that preserve provenance and openness.” (Open Knowledge Foundation, 2016)
