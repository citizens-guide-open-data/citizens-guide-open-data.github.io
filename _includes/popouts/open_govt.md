Open Government is a family of ideas and practises being adopted by states adapting to the demands of democracy in a digital age. [Canadaâ€™s Directive on Open Government](http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=28108) equates this with the proactive release of government data sets and documents. The belief held by policy makers is that by making the inner workings of government available to citizens, governments will be more accountable and transparent, because citizens can see why and how the government makes it decisions. The [Open Government Partnership](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/) is an international group of countries that are cooperating to accomplish these goals.
