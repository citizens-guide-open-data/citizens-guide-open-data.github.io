The *Open Data Instituteâ€™s* [Data Spectrum](https://theodi.org/data-spectrum) treats Openness as a matter of degree along with the type of data and the size of the data set. When data is the kind that many people might make useful information out of, it is better suited to being open: especially if it is not personal or commercial, and could pose risks if it was released.
