“Smart Cities” are generally those where governments have sought to modernize city management through the use of smaller and more pervasive wireless technologies. The concept recasts our cities and neighbourhoods as constant sources of data to be managed and processed. Early examples include roads that read and change signals based on traffic patterns as well as garbages that alert city employees when they are full. Smart cities require an infrastructure of embedded computers and sensors across the city, all connected and networked to send the data to government, or occasionally companies. While governments hope smart cities will reduce waste, increase efficiency, and improve public services in increasingly crowded urban areas, critics and academics have argued that this vision is too instrumentalist and does not adequately respond to the needs and desires of all of its citizens (Mattern, 2016; Greenfield, 2013).
