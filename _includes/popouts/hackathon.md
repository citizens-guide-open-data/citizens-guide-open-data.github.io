Hackathons are events, often weekend long, where people gather to cooperatively solve problems, code applications, and eat pizza. Hackathons are often accessible ways for people to pool their skills and create something together. Some hackathons are what we might call ‘civic hackathons’: they are either organized around solving public or community issues, or organized by governments. Geothink scholars Pamela Robinson and Peter Johnson argue that Hackathons might be used to cheaply get innovative ideas from citizens, rather than spending a lot of money on big projects; they also found that while hackathons did not often turn our viable products, they might in some cases be a good way of building capacities for citizens to participate in public life (Johnson and Robinson, 2014).
