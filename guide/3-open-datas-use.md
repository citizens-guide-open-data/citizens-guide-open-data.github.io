title: "What Can Open Data be Used For?"

Open data can be used for a huge range of projects and to meet goals outside of the public sector. A popular use continues to be governments releasing public sector information to engage with individuals and provide opportunities for entrepreneurship. Open Data is also used by researchers, particularly in the sciences, where the results of studies can be released alongside the paper so everyone can access the data that lead to the findings.

Open Data can also be used to tackle problems; this can be done by individuals, by informal groups or by established organizations. Open data allows communities to speak about issues affecting them in the same data-driven way that the government and other stakeholders. One example of what this might look like is shown in the [“Opening Data” Zine](https://www.alliedmedia.org/news/2015/09/17/opening-data-zine-here) (Detroit Digital Justice Coalition, 2015).    

Another is Citizen Science initiatives, like those undertaken by [Public Lab](https://publiclab.org/), collaborative approaches that provides the tools for groups to investigate and monitor environmental concerns (Public Lab, 2015).

## The Benefit of Open Data

A key goal of many Open Data proponents is providing a benefit and new value to citizens, communities, and organizations that are featured in the data. In order to argue for this value creation, municipal governments often use case studies as emblematic examples.

But it is important to ask: What kinds of value are created? For whom? Also, how does this value benefit those people the data is about? The examples mentioned above show improvements to transparency and government service delivery as the desired primary outcomes. Municipalities publishing Open Data hope that this service model will eventually expand the types of value it offers to citizens, leading to a more active relationship with government (Powell, 2015). Another view by some in the Open Data Movement, is that a more self-empowered, participatory, and knowledgeable citizen will emerge from Open Data efforts.
 
Despite the potential for Open Data to create more powerful citizens and more democratic governments, in practice, we are at the point where Open Data benefits a few highly skilled parties:

* those who *publish* data,  
* those who are able to *analyze* data, and
* those who are able to *work* with it.   

This mostly means enterprises and technologists have the agency to act on the data once made visible.

As Scassa points out (see Openness and Government above), the ability for powerful interests to profit from OD raises concerns about the commodification of data that describes people, which some might consider a public resource. Since larger corporations can use OD without much oversight, care must be taken to evaluate and call attention to their uses, such as using public OD sets to plan real-estate developments that might make housing less affordable.

As a result of this uneven ability to act, Open Data, as with other technologies, can entrench rather than resolve injustices we see in our cities and communities. In particular, Open Data can disenfranchise people who are already on the wrong side of  a digital divide: those who don’t have access to the internet, have lower income, or are  cultural minorities, as well as others (Shade, 2010). While data literacy can push back against this trend, action has to occur beyond the individual level to address this unevenness (Johnson, 2014). Open data could potentially be used by and benefit a much wider range of people with stories that can be told by data: those organizing in communities facing challenges or concerns, or actors in cities seeking to improve their communities for all people are all part of a data driven public sphere.
